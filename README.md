# Spotlight
Spotlight is a Fivem/FivePD modification that allows players to utilize fully controllable spotlights on their vehicles.

## Installation
Installation works like other FiveM scripts. Just drag and drop the `spotlight` folder into the server's resources folder, and add `ensure spotlight` to the server.cfg file. Restart the server.

## Usage
The default keybindings are:

```
L: Toggle spotlight
PageUp: Aim spotlight up
PageDown: Aim spotlight down
Delete: Aim spotlight left
End: Aim spotlight right
```
